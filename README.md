### Miles Marillo
Hello!
<img height="180em" src="https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=milesjamz&show_icons=true&hide_border=true&&count_private=true&include_all_commits=true" />

I'm a full stack software engineer interested in data visualization and analytics. I love writing software that enhances,
rather than reduces the humanity of its users, and finds interesting and new ways to display
data and discover connections. I write clean, tested code, self-manage independently,
and collaborate productively with teams.
